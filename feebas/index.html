    <h3>FAQ</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>Why is one of my Feebas tiles on the ground?</b></p>
        <p>
          This is not a bug in the calculator, this is a bug in BDSP. For some
          reason, the 4 ground tiles on the south side of the big rock can be
          selected as Feebas tiles, even though they  can't be fished. This
          will affect at most one tile per day.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>I only see one (or no) green square?</b></p>
        <p>
          It is possible that two of the potential tiles overlap. In this case,
          one of the red squares in guaranteed to work.
        </p>

      <li>
        <p><b>How does this work?</b></p>
        <p>
          See the <a href="#how-this-works">How this Works</a> section below.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Why are there two sets of tiles?</b></p>
        <p>
          The lottery number only gives us enough information to narrow down
          two of the four Feebas tiles with 50% certainty. See the
          <a href="#how-this-works">How this Works</a> section below for more
          details.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Why are there some tiles where Feebas never appears?</b></p>
        <p>
          Due to weird edge cases in the algorithm used by BDSP, there are 7
          tiles where Feebas will never appear. Overall, the code in BDSP seems
          way buggier than the approach used in DPPt.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>I checked both red and green tiles, and can't find Feebas?</b></p>
        <p>
          Make sure you're fishing the correct tile; your character should be on
          an adjacent tile, and your fishing bobber should be on the Feebas
          tile. Remember that even if you're fishing the correct tile, Feebas
          still only has a 50% spawn chance, so keep trying.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're very sure that none of the tiles are working, double check
          that your lottery number is correct. It's also possible that we
          missed something in reverse engineering the algorithm, and there's a
          bug in the calculator. Furthermore, this tool is based on v1.1.1 of the
          game, so a new update may have changed the algorithm.

    <h3>How this Works</h3>
    <p>
      Both the lottery number and Feebas tiles are based on the
      <i>group seed</i>. This is a number that is randomly generated once
      when you create your save and each time you create a new group.
      When other players join your group, their group seed is
      updated to match yours. Each day, this value is progressed following
      a predictable pattern (unimportant to this tool).
    </p>
    <p>
      The lottery number is computed as
      <code>(group_seed * 0x41c64e6d + 0x3039) &amp 0xffff</code>.
      Using this, we can calculate the 2 low bytes of the group seed as
      <code>(lotto * 0xeb65 + 0xa683) &amp 0xffff</code>
      (since the multiplicative inverse of <code>0x41c64e6d</code> is <code>0xeeb9eb65</code>
      and <code>0xeeb9eb65 * 0x3039 = 0xfc77a683</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The 4 Feebas tiles are each based on one of the 4 bytes of the absolute
      value of the group seed. First, 4 indexes are calculated:
      <ul>
        <li><code>(abs(group_seed) >> 24 &amp 0xff) % 0x84</code></li>
        <li><code>(abs(group_seed) >> 16 &amp 0xff) % 0x84 + 0x84 + 1</code></li>
        <li><code>(abs(group_seed) >> 8 &amp 0xff) % 0x84 + 0x84 * 2 + 2</code></li>
        <li><code>(abs(group_seed) &amp 0xff) % 0x84 + 0x84 * 3 + 3</code></li>
      </ul>
      Then each index is looked up in a table of tile positions that is simply
      top-left to bottom-right skipping rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we have the two low bytes of the group seed from the lottery
      number, we can find 2 Feebas tiles (in the bottom half).  Due to the
      absolute value, we have two possible possitions for each tile (since
      we don't know the high bit of the gorup seed). We then calculate the
      four possible values, two for each of the low bytes of the group seed.
